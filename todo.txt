- as userService use a real db
- as AuthServiceConfig use a wrapper around a ConfigService
    - in this config a serialized public and private key must be stored
    - so the AuthService can use its private key (and public key)
    - and also a separate client can use this public key
- => how to de/serialize keys ?
- look at the different out-commented JWT and JWS stuff, should that be used also?
- better use of TokenInvalidities
- use config-service for the authService, but only read from properties
    - key.private, key.public
    - key.public can then also be published and read by other clients, e.g. from a REST config server

- why so complicated to setup?
	- always a configService and keyvalueservice must be provided
	- authservice also needs a tokenservice
	- authservice-client also needs a config (and configservice and keyvalueservice again)
	==> some defaults ?
